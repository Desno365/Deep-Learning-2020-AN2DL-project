# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project

Computer engineering project made for the course: "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" at "Politecnico di Milano". Academic Year 2020/2021.

The project consists of 3 homeworks + an extra phase of model fine-tuning for the second homework.
The project has been developed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).


### Homework 1: Image Classification

Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks.
